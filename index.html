          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS:
            <ul>
              <li>inline CSS</li>
              <ul><li>
                When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file
              </li></ul>
              <li>internal CSS style sheet</li>
              <ul><li>An Internal Style sheet is when you embed an entire stylesheet directly into the HTML file using a stlyle element in the head element </li></ul>
              <li>external CSS style sheet</li>
              <ul><li>An external CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file</li></ul>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.
          </li>
          <li>A 'String' is a sequnce of text. A string is enclosed in single or double quote marks</li>
          <li>An 'Array' is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
          <li>An 'Object' can be anything. Everthing in JavaScript is an object and can be stored as a variable</li>
          <li>Note that whereas the style.css file is linked within the head element, the script.js file is linked within the body element.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts.</li>
              <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, 
                or if it is even executed at all.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in
            an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A 'for' loop contains the following three important statements</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>var x = 0;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The second statement is the condition.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>x < shapes.length;</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>x++</li>
                      </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>A 'for' loop starts with 'for'. So far our code looks like:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
                      // code block
                     }</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Finally, we put the code that we want to be executed for each loop inside curly brackets</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A 'function' is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        </ul>
