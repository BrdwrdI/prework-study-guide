## Usage

This site can be used to understand the core concepts that surround HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript as they were understood by myself. It is a collection of my notes that were taken while I worked my way through the Prework Module of this bootcamp. It will be useful to myself and other students as a tool to understand these concepts. If you open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for you to study first.
